## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r stockMarket}
library (ISLR)
names (Smarket) #look at columns/variables in the Smarket dataset
dim (Smarket) #dimension of the dataset
summary (Smarket)
pairs (Smarket) #produce a matrix of scatterplot to capture all pair-wise interactions between all vairables
cor (Smarket[,-9]) #correlation coefficients of the above matrix, minus the column that's not quantitative
attach (Smarket)
plot(Volume) #plot the column in Smarket that's named Volume
```
There appears to be little correlation between today’s returns and previous days’ returns.
The average number of shares traded daily increased from 2001 to 2005.

```{r logisticRegression}
#logsitic regression on the entire dataset
glm.fit =glm(Direction ~ Lag1+ Lag2+ Lag3+Lag4+ Lag5+Volume, data=Smarket , family=binomial)#fit a logistic regression, family = biomial indicates logistic regression
summary(glm.fit) #summary of the fitted model
coef(glm.fit) #look at coefficient only
summary(glm.fit)$coef #look at coefficients and ste, z value, and P values
glm.probs = predict(glm.fit, type ="response") #predict the training set because there is no test set, look at Probabilities of direction = up
glm.probs[1:10] #look at first tehn probabilities
contrasts(Direction) #direction = up is because R created 1 for Up

#check model accuracy
glm.pred=rep("Down", 1250) #replicate "Down" 1250 times (number of rows in Smarket dataset)
glm.pred[glm.probs > 0.5]="Up" #for all probabilities in glm.probs, if > 0.5, rename as "Up"
table(glm.pred, Direction) #confusion matrix
(507+145) /1250 #accuracy of the model
mean(glm.pred == Direction) #same as above, compute the fraction of days for which the prediction was correct

#split into train and test
train =(Year<2005) #extract Smarket's data before 2005
Smarket.2005= Smarket[!train,] #extract Smarket's data after 2005
dim(Smarket.2005) #see how many data points are included
Direction.2005= Direction[!train] #extract Direction's data after 2005
glm.fit =glm ( Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,data=Smarket, family = binomial, subset = train) #fit logistic regression only on the train (data before 2005)
glm.probs = predict(glm.fit, Smarket.2005, type ="response") #predict Directions on the test set

#check model accuracy
glm.pred=rep ("Down ", 252)
glm.pred[glm.probs >.5]="Up"
table(glm.pred, Direction.2005)
mean(glm.pred == Direction.2005) #fraction
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
